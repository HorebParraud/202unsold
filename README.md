<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

> This project was realized during my first year at EPITECH in 2018

In 2001, the Borwein brothers studied the following integrals, which now bear their name:

`∀n ∈ N, In = Z (+∞ 0) Y (n k=0) * (sin( x 2k+1 ) / (x / 2k+1)) * dx`

These integrals are remarkable because the first ones are all equal to `π/2`.An obvious conjecture would bethat this is true for every value of `n`.

Some decades ago, an old-school mathemacian would have had to hand-calculate the values of the first
integrals (which would take several months, or even years), then assume all the integrals are equal to `π/2`, and finally try and demonstrate this conjecture.

Today, we can use numerical calculus to evaluate as many of these integrals as possible before getting into a demonstration; this is the goal of this project.

You have to compute Borwein integrals, using the midpoint rule, the trapezoidal rule and the Simpson’s rule, and print both the value of `In` and the absolute difference between `In` and `π/2`.
